Ahh you must be the new attendent, I have been coming here for years. Get the same thing every time. Hope you make it longer than the last one did. Strange things happen out here in the middle of nowhere. Anyway Thank you and see later this week.

As you finish bagging this talkative customers multiple bottles of water, he pays and leaves without saying another word. What did he mean strange things, what happened to the last attendent? Why did he need so much water?
